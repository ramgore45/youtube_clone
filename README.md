# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Debouncing:=> Performance on Searching the things

    ex: Apple Iphone pro max

    =typing slow difference between two key stroke would be high(100 to 200ms)
        - call apis on each letter(high api call during search)
        -api calls = 20 calls on each letter
        -users 1000 = 1000*20 =20000 api calls at a time
    =typing fast difference between two key stroke would be less (less than 80ms, 50ms, 40ms)
        - call apis on group of letter or word(less api call during search)
        -api calls = less than 4 calls on each word or after complition of sentence/word
        -uers 1000 = 1000*3 = 3000 api calls at time

    # DEBOUNCING with 200ms 
        -if differnce between 2 keystroke is less than 200ms, decline the api calls
        -if differnce between 2 keystroke is more than 200ms, make the api calls(may required some suggestions)

        =>ex. Youtube debouncing 100ms and flipkart debouncing 200ms
